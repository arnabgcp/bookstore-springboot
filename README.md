# Google Cloud Platform environment setup and deploy modern application

The following example shows how you can set up a [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) and [Cloud SQL DB](https://cloud.google.com/sql) with terraform where modern aplication will be deployed and then set up an automated CI/CD pipeline using [Google Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) for regular enhancements

## What is Google Cloud Build?

Cloud Build lets you build software quickly across all languages. Get complete control over defining custom workflows
for building, testing, and deploying across multiple environments such as VMs, serverless, Kubernetes, or Firebase.
You can find out more on the [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/) website.

## What is Google Cloud SQL ?

Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that helps you set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational databases on Google Cloud Platform. You can use Cloud SQL with MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.You can find out more on the [Cloud SQL DB](https://cloud.google.com/sql) website.

## What is a Google Kubernetes Engine?

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) provides a managed environment for deploying, managing, and scaling your containerized applications using Google infrastructure. The GKE environment consists of multiple machines (specifically, Compute Engine instances) grouped together to form a cluster. You can find out more on the [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)

## Overview

In this guide we will walk through the steps necessary to set up a GKE cluster, cloud sql DB , deploy applications and create CI/CD pipeline using Cloud build. Here are the steps:

1. [Install the necessary tools](#installing-necessary-tools)
1. [Configure GKE cluster and deploy code](#Configure-GKE-cluster-and-deploy-code)
1. [Configure IAP and DNS ](#configure-iap-and-dns)
1. [Connect Cloud SQL DB](#connect-cloud-SQL-DB)
1. [Configure Cloud Build](#configuring-cloud-build)
1. [Trigger a build by pushing changes to GIT Repository](#triggering-a-build)
1. [View the deployment on a GKE cluster](#viewing-the-deployment)

## Installing necessary tools

In addition to `terraform`, this guide relies on the `gcloud` and `kubectl` tools to view build information and manage
the GKE cluster. This means that your system needs to be configured to be able to find `terraform`, `gcloud`, `kubectl`
client utilities on the system `PATH`. Here are the installation guides for each tool:

1. [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
1. [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
1. [`terraform`](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)

Make sure the binaries are discoverable in your `PATH` variable. See [this Stack Overflow
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix) for instructions on
setting up your `PATH` on Unix, and [this
post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows) for instructions on
Windows.

## Configure GKE cluster and deploy code

Now that we have installed necessary tools, we are ready to deploy all of the example resources in QA environment and PROD environment and also set up the Cloud
Build triggers!

QA Setup:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. If you haven't already, clone this repo:
   - `$ git clone https://github.com/arnabgcp/BookStore.git`
1. Make sure you are in the `gke-modernize` example folder:
   - `$ cd BookStore/gke-modernize`
1. please change below default fields of variables.tf file according to your setup

   - project (should be GCP exisitng project where cluster needs to be provisioned)
   - clsname (kubernetes cluster name of your choice)
   - region (region of your choice for eg: us-central1)
   
1. Initialize terraform:
   - `$ terraform init`
1. Check the terraform plan:
   - `$ terraform plan`
1. Apply the terraform code:
   - `$ terraform apply`
   

This Terraform code will:

- create a High Available Cloud SQL Data Base in the mentioned region and imports sample data into the Bookstore DB
- Create a publicly accessible GKE cluster
- Deploy application containers on the GKE cluster (source docker images are stored on public docker hub)
- Creates an [Ingress Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) for accessing the application
- show output of DB insatance which will be used in step [Connect Cloud SQL DB](#connect-cloud-SQL-DB)

At the end of `terraform apply`, we need to wait for 5-10 minutes to have a working cluster with application running on it

PROD Setup :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. If you haven't already, clone this repo:
   - `$ git clone https://github.com/apskarthick/bookstoreonk8s.git`
1. Make sure you are in the `terraform/gke-modernize-prod` example folder:
   - `$ cd bookstoreonk8s/terraform/gke-modernize-prod`
1. please change below default fields of variables.tf file according to your setup

   - project (should be GCP exisitng project where cluster needs to be provisioned)
   - clsname (kubernetes cluster name of your choice)
   - region (region of your choice for eg: us-central1)
   
1. Initialize terraform:
   - `$ terraform init`
1. Check the terraform plan:
   - `$ terraform plan`
1. Apply the terraform code:
   - `$ terraform apply`
   please take a note of the public ip
1. go to section [Configure IAP and DNS ](#configure-iap-and-dns) for DNS and IAP setup

This Terraform code will:

- create a High Available Cloud SQL Data Base in the mentioned region and imports sample data into the Bookstore DB
- Create a publicly accessible GKE cluster
- Deploy application containers on the GKE cluster (source docker images are stored on public docker hub)
- Creates an [Ingress Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) for accessing the application
- Reserve a Public IP and shows the output (please take a note of this, we need this during [Configure IAP and DNS ](#configure-iap-and-dns)  section )
- create backend config and added annotations for IAP
- show output of DB insatance which will be used in step [Connect Cloud SQL DB](#connect-cloud-SQL-DB)
- applied all required yaml files for SSL configurarions

At the end of `terraform apply`, we need to wait for 60 minutes (DNS refresh takes time) to have a working cluster with application running on it

## Configure IAP and DNS

For [Identity aware proxy (IAP)](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/enabling-kubernetes-howto)  , please follow google documentation. Please follow the setps only upto my-secret creation, further steps have been taken care while [Configure GKE cluster and deploy code](#Configure-GKE-cluster-and-deploy-code) execution prod setup section.

Once IAP setup is completed , please follow below steps to provide access to individual users or groups so that they can access the Bookstore application.

1. If you haven't already, clone this repo:
   - `$ git clone https://github.com/apskarthick/bookstoreonk8s.git`
1. Make sure you are in the `terraform/gke-iap` example folder:
   - `$ cd bookstoreonk8s/terraform/gke-iap`
1. please change/add below fields of main.tf file according to your need

   member = "user:testuserm@gmail.com"
   
1. Initialize terraform:
   - `$ terraform init`
1. Check the terraform plan:
   - `$ terraform plan`
1. Apply the terraform code:
   - `$ terraform apply`


For DNS configuration please point your choise of domain adress to the previously noted public ip during [Configure GKE cluster and deploy code](#Configure-GKE-cluster-and-deploy-code) prod execution.


## Connect Cloud SQL DB

in [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) please login with your credential and select required project. Please navigate to cloud sql and select the instance created by above terrfaorm script. Please create a user and set password , please take a note of this user name and password for future use.

please connect to this DB by running below command

1. INSTANCE_NAME should point to [Configure GKE cluster and deploy code](#Configure-GKE-cluster-and-deploy-code) QA/PROD setup DB insatnce output
1. gcloud sql instances patch $INSTANCE_NAME --assign-ip
1. gcloud sql connect $INSTANCE_NAME --user=(created above) --quiet
1. it will prompt for password, please use above created password
1. now you can run regular Sql commands to verify DB details


## Configuring Cloud Build

Your GCP project needs to be configured properly in order to use this example. This is necessary to allow Cloud Build
to access resources such as the GKE cluster.

1. If you haven't already done so, ensure the [Cloud Build API is enabled](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudbuild.googleapis.com) in your GCP project.
   - Alternatively you may run: `gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com --project=$PROJECT`
1. Next you will need connect git repository from cloud build

    - in [console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) please login with your credential and select required project
    - go to cloud build and select connect repository
    - select source as GitHub
    - authenticate with github credentials
    - select target repository
    - check agreement requirements and connect
       
1. Next cloud build trigger needs to be added with below terraform code.
 
1. If you haven't already, clone this repo:
   - `$ git clone https://github.com/arnabgcp/BookStore.git`
1. Make sure you are in the `gke-modernize` example folder:
   - `$ cd BookStore/gke-modernize`
1. please change below default fields of variables.tf file according to your setup

   - project (should be GCP exisitng project where cluster needs to be provisioned)
   - clsname (kubernetes cluster name of your choice)
   - region (region of your choice for eg: us-central1)
   
1. Initialize terraform:
   - `$ terraform init`
1. Check the terraform plan:
   - `$ terraform plan`
1. Apply the terraform code:
   - `$ terraform apply`

For more information on the Cloud Build service account, refer to Appendix A at the bottom of this document.


## Triggering a Build

To trigger a build we need to commit and push some changes to the Cloud Source Repository. For the purposes of this
example, we have prepared a [sample GitHub repository](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/sample-app-docker) with a
basic application. We recommend you clone this repository and push it to the Cloud Source Repository that was created
in the previous step.

1. Clone the `sample-app-docker` repo to an empty directory outside of this example:
   - `$ git clone https://github.com/gruntwork-io/sample-app-docker.git`
1. Add the the Cloud Source Repository as a remote:
   - `$ git remote google ssh://[EMAIL]@source.developers.google.com:2022/p/[PROJECT_ID]/r/[REPO_NAME]`
   - **Note:** Be sure to replace the [EMAIL] (Google IAM user's address), [PROJECT_ID] and [REPO_NAME] with your values.
1. Push the sample app to the Cloud Source Repository
   - `$ git push --all google`

After you've pushed the changes to Google Source Repositories, Cloud Build will automatically trigger a new build. You
can view the build status directly in the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds).

![Cloud Build History](_docs/gcp-build-history.png)

Or by using the `gcloud` CLI tool:

```
$ gcloud builds list --limit=5
```

During the build Cloud Build will install the sample app's dependencies, execute the tests, build a docker image,
push it to the GCR registry then create a deployment on the GKE cluster.

## Viewing the Deployment

If the build completed successfully, it should have been deployed to the GKE cluster and exposed as a service using a
Load Balancer. We can verify this by checking the output using `gcloud`:

1. View the most recent builds and copy the build id:
   - `$ gcloud builds list --limit=5`
1. Stream the logs for the most recent build and find the service details:
   - `$ gcloud builds log <BUILD_ID>`


Or by using the `kubectl` command:

1. Configure `kubectl` to use the GKE cluster:
   - `$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials example-private-cluster --region europe-west3`
1. List the available services:
   - `$ kubectl get ingress -n qa`
   - `$ kubectl get ingress -n prod`
1. Open the external IP in your browser:
   - `$ open <EXTERNAL_IP>`
   - `$ open <domain adress>`

## Appendix A: Cloud Build Service Account

Cloud Build executes your builds using a service account, a special Google account that executes builds on your behalf. The email for
the Cloud Build service account is `[PROJECT_NUMBER]@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`. When you enable the Cloud Build API, the service
account is automatically created and granted the Cloud Build Service Account role for your project. This role is sufficient for severa;
tasks, including fetching code from Cloud Source Repositories, pushing and pulling Docker images to Container Registry, however it
does not allow Cloud Build to deploy to Kubernetes Engine clusters. Therefore you need to manually enable our service account to
perform these actions by granting the account additional IAM roles. For more information, refer to: https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/securing-builds/set-service-account-permissions.
